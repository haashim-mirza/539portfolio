                    Over the past 4 years, my focus in Data Science has centered on harnessing the power of Python
                    libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and NumPy. Through various projects, I've adeptly employed these
                    tools to analyze, visualize, and manipulate data, demonstrating a deep understanding of their
                    capabilities.

                    <p>Over the past 4 years, I've had extensive experience with Python in the course of my research,
                        classwork, and personal projects involving artificial intelligence, computer vision and speech
                        processing. I have a complete grasp of Machine Learning tools including TensorFlow, Pytorch,
                        Keras and OpenCV.</p>

                    <p>In the past 3 years, I've honed my expertise in backend development, particularly with Node.js
                        and Flask. Proficient in these frameworks, I've seamlessly crafted robust and scalable web
                        applications. Whether leveraging the asynchronous nature of Node.js for real-time applications
                        or utilizing Flask's simplicity for versatile projects, my journey in backend development has
                        been marked by a commitment to efficient and reliable solutions.</p>

                    <p>In the past year I have also dived into exploring amazon web services and incorporating Amazon
                        lambda, EC2 instances, DynamoDB and Amazon S3 and exploring further AWS features for Devops and
                        Development.</p>

                    <p>In my journey in backend development, I've also specialized in database management, showcasing
                        proficiency in MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. Whether ensuring scalability with MongoDB's NoSQL
                        structure, managing relational databases with MySQL, or employing the robustness of PostgreSQL,
                        my expertise lies in designing and optimizing data storage solutions to meet diverse application
                        requirements.</p>
